# rusttwald
### Inofficial Rust API client for the [mittwald.](mittwald.de) API.

## Introduction

This OpenAPI spec documents the mittwald API. It follows the
[OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0.html).

## Authentication

You will need an API token to access the API. You can obtain one by logging into the
[mStudio](https://studio.mittwald.de) and navigating to the
[\"API Tokens\" section in the user menu](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/profile/api-tokens).

When making requests to the API, you can authenticate by passing your API token in the `X-Access-Token` header or as a
bearer token.

## Rate Limiting

Please note that usage of the API is rate-limited to prevent abuse. You can inspect the rate limiting for your current
user by observing the `X-Ratelimit-*` headers included in each response.

[mStudio](https://studio.mittwald.de).
