/*
 * Mittwald API
 *
 * ## Introduction  This OpenAPI spec documents the mittwald API. It follows the [OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0.html).  ## Authentication  You will need an API token to access the API. You can obtain one by logging into the [mStudio](https://studio.mittwald.de) and navigating to the [\"API Tokens\" section in the user menu](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/profile/api-tokens).  When making requests to the API, you can authenticate by passing your API token in the `X-Access-Token` header or as a bearer token.  ## Rate Limiting  Please note that usage of the API is rate-limited to prevent abuse. You can inspect the rate limiting for your current user by observing the `X-Ratelimit-*` headers included in each response.  ## mStudio  A main consumer of the mittwald API is the management interface for our customers, the [mStudio](https://studio.mittwald.de).  ## Contact and support  For support, please use the [mStudio support area](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/support/conversations) or drop us an email at [support@mittwald.de](mailto:support@mittwald.de).  For security issues, please report to [security@mittwald.de](mailto:security@mittwald.de).
